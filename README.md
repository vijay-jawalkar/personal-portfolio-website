In this project, I utilized the latest web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and develop a responsive personal portfolio website. The site showcases my personal details, education, skills, and contact information in a user-friendly and visually appealing way. By leveraging my knowledge of web development, I was able to create a professional and polished online presence that has heightened my visibility and amplified my reach in the industry. As a result, my portfolio website has become a powerful tool for building my personal brand and advancing my career as a web developer.
